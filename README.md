## Bug reporting and contributing

Everything you need to know about bug reporting and contributing [is located here](https://github.com/owncloud/gallery/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Preparation
Here is a list of steps you might want to take before using the app

### Supporting more media types
First, make sure you have installed ImageMagick and its imagick PECL extension.
Next add a few new entries to your **config/config.php** configuration file.

```
  'preview_max_scale_factor' => 1,
  'enabledPreviewProviders' =>
  array (
    0 => 'OC\\Preview\\PNG',
    1 => 'OC\\Preview\\JPEG',
    2 => 'OC\\Preview\\GIF',
    11 => 'OC\\Preview\\Illustrator',
    12 => 'OC\\Preview\\Postscript',
    13 => 'OC\\Preview\\Photoshop',
    14 => 'OC\\Preview\\TIFF'
  ),
```

Look at the sample configuration (config.sample.php) in your config folder if you need more information about how the config file works.
That's it. You should be able to see more media types in your slideshows and galleries as soon as you've installed the app.

### Improving performance

#### Redis for files locking

Using Redis for files locking improves performance **by a factor of 10** when loading an album.

Read about it in the [ownCloud](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/9/admin_manual/configuration_files/files_locking_transactional.html) or [Nextcloud](https://docs.nextcloud.org/server/9/admin_manual/configuration_files/files_locking_transactional.html) Administration Manual

#### Assets pipelining
Make sure to enable "asset pipelining", so that all the Javascript and CSS resources can be mixed together.
This can greatly reduce the loading time of the app.

Read about it in the [ownCloud](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/9.0/admin_manual/configuration_server/js_css_asset_management_configuration.html) or [Nextcloud](https://docs.nextcloud.org/server/9/admin_manual/configuration_server/js_css_asset_management_configuration.html) Administration Manual
